# FBGFX

A demo of directly drawing on kernel framebuffer.

This should be in conflict with `Kernel Mode Settings` (`KMS`) or `Direct Rendering Manager` (`DRM`). Yet to be tested on desktop environment.

### Special notes on Raspberry Pi 4

Works when and only when neither `vc4-kms-v3d` nor `vc4-fkms-v3d` was set.
